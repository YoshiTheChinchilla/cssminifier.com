Just a short note to say that *clean-css* has been upgraded from the v1.1.x series to the
[v2.x.x](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css/blob/master/History.md#200--2013-11-04) series.

It looks like this release is pretty big, including changing the code over to a more Object Oriented interface. For
[cssminifier.com](/) of course, this doesn't affect you so just keep doing what you're doing with the
[same API](/examples) as before.

Other things which look nice are the changeover to a token parser so that
[clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css/) can perform more optimisations, so it looks like
they're doing amazing things. Thanks (as always) to GoalSmashers for an amazing library.
