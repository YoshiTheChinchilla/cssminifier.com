Django Helper

[Gustavo Vargas](https://github.com/xgvargas) has written a Django helper (plugin?) which allows you to use
both [CSSMinifier](http://cssminifier.com/) and [JavaScript Minifier](http://javascript-minifier.com/) from
within your projects. Cool aye?

The GitHub repo is here and named [js-css-min-django](https://github.com/xgvargas/js-css-min-django). It describes itself as
"JS and CSS automated merge and minifier. Optionally can parse django template tags in css and js files.". Let's face it, anything
that is automated is a win!

Thanks Gustavo!
