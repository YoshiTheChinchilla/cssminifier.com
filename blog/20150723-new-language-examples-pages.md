CSS Minifier now has a whole new set of pages showing lots of different language examples. It's a great resource
and most of the code has been contributed by our users, so thanks to everyone concerned. Every person is credited
on the page/language that they sent in, so if you bump into them, please say thank you. :)

The entire list of languages we now have are:

* [wget](/wget)
* [Curl](/curl)
* [node.js](/nodejs)
* [Python](/python)
* [Ruby](/ruby)
* [Perl](/perl)
* [PHP](/php)
* [C#](/c-sharp)

There is also a new [plugins](/plugins) page and a [programs](/programs) page.

Thanks again to everyone and of course to you all for supporting this site, it's getting more and more use every week.
