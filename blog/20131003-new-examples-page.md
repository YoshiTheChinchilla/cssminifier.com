I've just added a new [examples](/examples) page so that I could get more in depth on how to use [cssminifier.com](/)
from various programming languages. Currently there are examples of using *curl*, *node.js*, *PHP* and *LWP Request*
with more to come.

This also minimises the stuff that it at the bottom of the homepage and just focuses on the main function of the site.

I'd love to get more examples in a language of your choice so send me something and I'll put it up. Toni Almeida sent
me a link to a project he wrote called [PHP JS CSS Minifier](https://github.com/promatik/PHP-JS-CSS-Minifier) which is
a PHP library which uses [CSS Minifier](/) and [JavaScript Minifier](http://javascript-minifier.com) to automatically
minimise assets. He uses it prior to releasing to production. I have also linked to this project from the examples
page.

Thanks for using CSS Minfiier and send any suggestions to [@andychilton](https://twitter.com/andychilton) (and follow
me too!). I'll keep trying to update the site with more stuff as time goes on, as well as more up to date code.

Have fun and happy CSS'ing!
